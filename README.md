Description
===========

lambda-ftp-collector was a learning exercise, an occasion for myself to learn Lambda and NodeJs.
It is composed of a set of AWS Lambda function to collect files via FTP into an AWS S3 bucket.


Origin of the project
=====================

A large number of IT projects I have been involved with starts by collecting a set of files from a customer, on a regular basis or as a one off. Often via SFTP, more rarely via FTP.
Amazon provides some good tools for ingesting data (Kinesis), but it assumes that the data is being sent and not collected.

I wanted to create a set of tool easily configurable to collect files via FTP / SFTP.
It is also a pretext for me to experiment with Lambda and NodeJS.

Requirements:
================================

* Download files matching a file mask from a (S)FTP server into a S3 Bucket
* Handle large number of files (tens of thousands)
* Be reliable (retry when FTP is not available)


Why has the project been stopped
================================

In retrospect, the use case I picked, SFTP file download, is not really suited for Lambda.
Lambda offer very little control on its concurrency and this quickly became a problem. When dealing with large number of files, too many connections would be open, flooding the SFTP server.


Testing
=======
I strongly recommend to use node-lamba for local development

```
npm install -g node-lambda
node-lambda setup
node-lambda -f deploy.env run
node-lambda -f deploy.env deploy
```


Architecture
=======
The ftpLister function takes a path, a file mask a bucket name and a sourceId to reference FTP address and credentials as paramteres.
It will list all the files matching the file mask and write an entry in a DynamoDb table for each of them.

The ftpTransferer function takes a path, a file name, a bucket name and a sourceId to reference FTP address and credentials as paramteres.
It will download the file and upload it or stream it to the s3 bucket. Files are downloaded to /tmp and uploaded to S3 if less than 50Mb, they are streamed directly to the bucket if larger.



API TO BE UPDATED
===

Event
------
* path - _string_ - the remote path of files to be collected
* mask - _string_ - Regular expression - only filenames matching the expression will be collected
* source - _object_ - with the following properties:
    * type - _string_ - only ftp supported for now
    * host - _string_ - The hostname or IP address of the FTP server. **Default:** 'localhost'
    * port - _integer_ - The port of the FTP server. **Default:** 21
    * secure - _mixed_ - Set to true for both control and data connection encryption, 'control' for control connection encryption only, or 'implicit' for implicitly encrypted control connection (this mode is deprecated in modern times, but usually uses port 990) **Default:** false
    * secureOptions - _object_ - Additional options to be passed to `tls.connect()`. **Default:** (none)
    * user - _string_ - Username for authentication. **Default:** 'anonymous'
    * password - _string_ - Password for authentication. **Default:** 'anonymous@'
    * connTimeout - _integer_ - How long (in milliseconds) to wait for the control connection to be established. **Default:** 10000
    * pasvTimeout - _integer_ - How long (in milliseconds) to wait for a PASV data connection to be established. **Default:** 10000
    * keepalive - _integer_ - How often (in milliseconds) to send a 'dummy' (NOOP) command to keep the connection alive. **Default:** 10000
* dest - _object_ - with the following properties:
  * type - _string_ - only s3 supported for now
  * bucketName - _string_ - S3 bucket to which the files will be downloaded to



  Sample
  ------
  ```
  {
    "path": "/tmp/test",
    "mask": ".*\\.txt",
    "source": {
          "type":  "ftp",
          "host":  "ftp.example.com",
          "user":    "username",
          "password":  "password"
        },
    "dest": {
          "type":  "s3",
          "bucketName":  "my-s3-bucket"
        }

  }
  ```

Output
------
* files - _array_ - array of objects with the following properties
  * fileName - _string_
  * size - _number_ - In Bytes
  * status - _string_ - with one of the following
    * s3 - The file has been succesfully downloaded to S3
    * ftp_error - An error occured when downloading the file
    * s3_error - The file could be downloaded but an error occured while uploading it to s3
  * error - _string_ - error short description
  * bucketName - _string_ - S3 bucket to where the file is stored
